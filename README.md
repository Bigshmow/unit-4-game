# unit-4-game
week-04-Jquery/Homework
This is the Jquery homework for UCSD Coding BootCamp.

The project is a game that enables users to interact with crystals in order to guess the random number.  Each crystal also has a random number assigned to it every new round. 

Click or tap the crystals and try to increment your score to equal the random number.  If you go over the guess number you will lose but never fear there is always next time!

The goal of this project was to demonstrate Jquery knowledge in updating a page and its elemnts dynamically.
